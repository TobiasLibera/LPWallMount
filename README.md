# LP Wall Mount

<br></br>

Long story short, my sister gave two painted LPs.\
So I decided to design a simple wall mount for them.

<br></br>

### Description

The whole mount can be installed to a wall by using a small nail or a small srew.\
Please mind, the head of the nail or screw shouldn't be thicker than 1.2mm.\
\
Also, you need ***1 additional M3x6 screw*** to fit the two parts together. Where the thread length is 6mm.\
\
STEP files of the parts are also available, so it should be easy to modify the parts to your needs.\

<br></br>

### Before Printing

Before printing, I recommend to print the ***LPW_Test_ScrewHole_M3*** part once, to check if you can tighten the M3 screw into the screw hole.\
The nominal diameter of the hole is ***2.93mm***, which works good for my printer and my slicer settiungs. Maybe you need another value to get a good fit. Feel free to modify the STEP files.\

<br></br>

### Printing Times

With my settings, which can be found in the Documentation folder the printing took:

- ***LPW_Mount***:&nbsp;~ 21&nbsp;minutes
- ***LPW_Cap***:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~ 6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;minutes

<br></br>

### Sisters Shop

My sister owns an Etsy shop.\
If you like the painted LPs in the pics, you maybe like to give her shop a little visit.\
